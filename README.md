# SRT411-Assignment-0

The following document are reports formatted in: html, Rmd, and docx documenting Assignment 0. Supplementary scripts done in the exercises has also been included as part of the repository.

#### **Notes for the grading professor:**

**For grading Assignment 0:** Please click on the file 'assignment0.md'

**For viewing the html file:** Since the uploaded html file has been truncated, and viewing the full file doesn't format the html source code that has been produced by R Markdown and knitr, here is an alternate solution.
Please download the entire zip file either through the GUI or using the command:

`git clone https://github.com/eaneatfruit/SRT411-Assignment-0.git`

Then by clicking the html file, it will open the report in html in the browser. If you do not wish to view in html format, a docx and Rmd file has also been provided for the grading professor's viewing pleasure. Simply download the said docx or Rmd file.
